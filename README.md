<h2>In Command-Line-Practice . . .</h2>

I will connect an <em>already existing local project</em> to a remote server, namely <strong>GitHub</strong>!

The steps are:
<ol>
    <li>git init</li>
    <li>Create GitHub repo</li>
    <li>git remote add origin...</li>
    <li>git remote -v (to check)</li>
    <li>git branch -M main</li>
    <li>git status, add, commit</li>
    <li>git push -u origin main</li>
</ol>

<h4>By the way . . .</h4>

This README.md is edited from VSCode, and never via GitHub.

Snapshots are always pushed from the command line.

The first letter of commit messages should be capitalized.
