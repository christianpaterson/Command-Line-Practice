<h1>Git Practice</h1>

<h2>Here we go...</h2>

<p>I will attempt to connect this remote repository (which has a README.md file) with a local repository 
    (which does not have a README.md file, or has a vastly different README.md file) using git init, git 
    remote add origin URL, git branch -M main, git push -u origin main</p>

<h4>This is the test. The local version <em>does not</em> have the same README.md</h4>


<h5>What I had to do was the following:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>git status</li>
    <li>git pull origin main</li>
    <li>..."The following untracked files would be overwritten by merge"</li>
    <li>git add, commit</li>
    <li>git pull origin main</li>
    <li>..."fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"</li>
    <li>git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories</li>
    <li>..."Merge conflict in README.md"</li>
    <li>git push --set-upstream origin main</li>
    <li>..."Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart"</li>
    <li>git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories</li>
    <li>git add, commit, push --set-upstream origin master</li>
</ul>

<h5>I will try to do this again more effectively.</h5>

<p>I have now made changes remotely, and locally.<br>
What I had to do this time:</p>
<ul>
    <li>git status</li>
    <li>git add, commit</li>
    <li>git push --set-upstream origin main</li>
    <li>..."The remote contains work that you do not have locally"</li>
    <li>git pull origin main</li>
    <li>git pull --rebase</li>
    <li>git push --set-upstream origin main</li>
</ul>

<h5>The third time I only had to use:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>git status</li>
    <li>git add, commit</li>
    <li>git pull origin main</li>
    <li>git push --set-upstream origin main</li>
</ul>
